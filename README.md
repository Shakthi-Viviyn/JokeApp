# Joke App

## Installation

To get the server ready, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/Shakthi-Viviyn/jokeapp.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd jokeapp```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:
```npm install```


## Environment Configuration

To add an API key to your React app, you'll need to set up an `.env.local` file in the root directory. Here's how:

1. Create a new file named `.env.local`.

2. Add the API key in the following format to the `.env.local` file:
```REACT_APP_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'```
**Note:** Make sure to keep this file private  and never commit it to version control, as it contains sensitive information.

 ## Starting the Server 
 To start the development server and run your React app, use the following command:
```npm start```


This will start the server and open the app in your default web browser. Now you can view the React app locally.

Happy coding! :rocket:
